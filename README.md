# Semi-Scientific Calculator
This final project of the foundations section in the Odin Project. It was made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. For this project, I chose a more in-depth implemenation than required. This calculator allows for inputs similar to a standard graphing calculator. The design was created by [elisgraf](https://dribbble.com/shots/9631225--Design-for-DailyUi-Day004-Calculator?utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=eilsgraff&utm_content=%23Design%20for%20%23DailyUi%20%23Day004%20%23Calculator&utm_medium=Social_Share&utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=eilsgraff&utm_content=%23Design%20for%20%23DailyUi%20%23Day004%20%23Calculator&utm_medium=Social_Share) on dribbble.
